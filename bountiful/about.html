            <h3>Our History</h3>
            <p>
                Bountiful Foods Started as a small booth at a farmers market in 2003. We used to grow small batches of crops
                in our own garden and wanted to share the abaundance with others. After a few years at the farmers market, we realized
                that it was nearly impossible to find organic, locally grown food anywhere else! We wanted to bring healtier whole foods 
                to the people of Carlsbad, so we started working with other local farmers and began selling fresh produce out of a food truck. 
                Eventually our food truck took off, and we expanded to another food truck, and soon, our store front. We now offer, not only fresh produce,
                but a wide variety of organic whole foods from all over the world. We make sure that all of our products are sourced ethically and contain 
                the best ingredients. Bountiful Foods is now so much more than our first little booth. Come by to visit and get our famous fresh fruit smoothies!

            <h3>Supporting Local Farms</h3>
            <p>
                Our produce is sourced from local farmers to support the local economy and to provide the best quality produce
                to our customers. We strive to support other local businesses and believe in building a strong community
                where everyone helps each other. Our local farmers are committed to farming in ethical and environmentally safe ways.
                We make sure that nothing goes to waste, so any produce past it's prime is turned into compost for future crops or fed to 
                the local farm animals to keep their diet healthy and clean. We love our farmers and hope that you love our food too!
