                The Star Valley Ranch town hall has been in operation since January of 2021. Before then, the chamber of commerce
                and other city officials had to rent other buildings for use of city business. The new town hall has been a 
                great blessing to those who are able to use it, and has prodvided a place where we, as a community, can council together
                and make Star Valley a great place to live.
