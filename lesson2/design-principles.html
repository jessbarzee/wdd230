            <h3>Hicks's Law</h3>
            <h4>Amazon</h4>
            <a href="amazon.com">amazon.com</a>

            <p>
                Hick's Law states that the more options that are available to a person, the longer it will take for them
                to make a decision. Amazon is a great exampls of Hick's Law in web design as it present's it's viewers 
                with so many optiont when you first open the page. You can search for an item you need, or you can
                view products by category. If you don't know what you need, there are four links to recommendations
                for "lightening deals" and other special offers. I do not think that Amazon's overall mobile view port 
                is very clean, but they do a good job at making their viewers stay for a while and browse with their use
                of Hick's Law in their design.

        <div class="contrast">
            <h3>Contrast</h3>
            <h4>National Geographic</h4>
            <a href="nationalgeographic.com">nationalgeographic.com</a>
            <img src="images/natgeo.jpg" alt="National Geographic">
            
            <p>
                Contrast is probably one of the easiest design elements to recognize but one of the hardest
                to make look good. The white text against the black background is the main contrasting element
                that adds a sophistcated look to the page. The other main contrasting element on the page is the 
                yellow underline under the word "subsricbe." Not only does the yellow contrast against the black
                background and the white text, but it draws the viewers eyes to it almost immediately. I found this 
                to be a great design element because the most importnat thing for a site/magazine like National 
                Geographic would be to get more subscribers.

            <img src="images/halfbakedharvest.jpg" alt="Half Baked Harvest">

            <p>
                Half-Baked Harvest is my favorite food blog that I follow. I wanted to focus on her website, because 
                her design us very clean and friendly looking. When analyzing the Half-Baked Harvest site, I noticed that 
                the overall site had great alginment, which gave the overall site a welcoming and refreshing look. The 
                picure I included shoes four images of different recipes all equally aligned in the viewport. I was
                impressed with the mobile viewport of this site and how easy it was to navigate.
